# Example Integrations

Failsafe was designed to integrate nicely with other libraries and APIs. Here are some example integrations:

* [Java 8][java8-example]
* [Async][async-example]
* [Netty][netty-example]
* [RxJava][rxjava-example]
* [Vert.x][vertx-example]
* [Circuit Breaker Operator based on RxJava2](https://github.com/venth/failsafe-rxjava2)
* [Circuit Breaker Operator based on Spring Reactor](https://github.com/venth/failsafe-reactor)

Feel free to [edit]({{ site.web-github-url }}/edit/master/example-integrations.md) this page add additional integrations.
