# Third Party Tools

Several excellent third-party tools exist for Failsafe:

* [Diehard](https://github.com/sunng87/diehard) - A Clojure wrapper for Failsafe
* [Failsafe actuator](https://github.com/zalando-incubator/failsafe-actuator) - A simple monitoring interface for Failsafe in Spring boot applications.
* [Scala Failsafe](https://github.com/wsargent/scala-failsafe) - A very thin Scala wrapper around Failsafe
* [failsafe-kotlin](https://github.com/debop/failsafe-kotlin) - Provides Failsafe extension methods and DSL

Feel free to [edit](https://github.com/jhalterman/failsafe/edit/gh-pages/third-party-tools.md) this page to add additional tools.
